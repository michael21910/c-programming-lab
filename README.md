## Problems and Description
* [Week2](Week2)
    * [week2-1](Week2/week2-1.c)
        * Description: A man walks X km in Y hours  in the same direction. What is the man's velocity in km/h for the journey?
        * Input: Input contain two number in a line and separate by a single space, first number stand for distance in km, second number stand for time in hour.
        * Output: A number stand for velocity in km/h, please rounded to six decimal places.
    * [week2-2](Week2/week2-2.c)
        * Description: Read a 4 digit number, reverse it and display it.
        * Input: A 4 digit number, first digit is not 0.
        * Output: A 4 digit number after reverse.
    * [week2-3](Week2/week2-3.c)
        * Description: Read in a number, round it down to an integer and display on screen.
        * Input: A number.
        * Output: Display the integer after round down.
    * [week2-4](Week2/week2-4.c)
        * Description: Please write a program allow user input two integer and print out the result of addition subtraction multiplication  division and modulo of two integer.
        * Input: Two integer separate by a single space.
        * Output: See sample output.
    * [week2-5](Week2/week2-5.c)
        * Description: Please write a program allow user input two floating point number and print out the result of addition, subtraction, multiplicationanddivision of two number.
        * Input: Two floating point number separate by a single space
        * Output: See sample output
    * [week2-6](Week2/week2-6.c)
        * Description: Gave you a number n, please find the maximum even number less than or equal to n.
        * Input: An positive integer n.
        * Output: An largest even number less than or equal to n.
* [Week3](Week3)
    * [week3-1](Week3/week3-1.c)
        * Description: Please input an integer, determine if the integer is odd or even.
        * Input: Just an integer.
        * Output: output "odd" if the integer is odd, "even" if the integer is even.
    * [week3-2](Week3/week3-2.c)
        * Description: Read in two integer m and n, determine if m is multiple of n.
        * Input: Input will be two integer m and n separate by a single space.
        * Output: Please reference the sample out
    * [week3-3](Week3/week3-3.c)
        * Description: We use two points to present a segment in one dimensional coordinates. Give you two segment, your job is to determine two segment are overlay or not.
        * Input: Input consist 4 integer, first two present segment 1, and follow two present segment 2.
        * Output: Print "overlay" if two segment overlay, "no overlay" if not.
    * [week3-4](Week3/week3-4.c)
        * Description: Three segment length a, b, c, c has maximum length, if a + b > c than these three segment can construct a triangle. If a * a + b * b = c * c it will be a "right triangle", if a * a + b * b > c * c it will be a "acute triangle", if a * a + b * b < c * c it will be a "obtuse triangle". Write a program to determine what kind of triangle it will be.
        * Input: Input consist three integer a, b, c, c will be the maximum value.
        * Output: 如果三個線段可以構成一個三角形，就輸出他是哪種三角形，如果是銳角三角形就輸出 "acute triangle" ，如果是鈍角三角形就輸出 "obtuse triangle" ，如果是直角三角形就輸出 "right triangle"。如果三個線段無法構成一個三角形則輸出 "can not construct"
